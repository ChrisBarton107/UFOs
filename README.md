# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the analysis was to display UFO data with a dynamic webpage. The analysis was performed by enabling users to filter UFO sighting data based on event date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary
The design of the analysis enables the user to extract necessary information but could be improved by the addition of drop down arrows in the filtering area. The current design does not enable the user to know all possible search parameters and could be improved by providing the user with said parameters
