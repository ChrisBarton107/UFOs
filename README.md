# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the analysis was to display UFO data with a dynamic webpage. The analysis was performed by enabling users to filter UFO sighting data based on event date, city, state, country, and shape.

Webpage deployment: http://chrisbarton107/github.io/UFOs
## Results

### UFO Main Page
Display of the main page with the filter criteria on the left side and an icon labeled "UFO Sightings" located in the top left corner to refresh and reset a filtered table

### Filter by Date
Located on the left side of the page is the filter table. This table enables the user to filter data based on date, city, state, country, and shape. Pictured is data filtered by date, with input of 1/5/2010. The resulting table shows all data with this date.

### Filter by Date And Shape
The filter table used on this page can be used on more than one criteria concurrently. If the user desires, they can input up to five criteria with the current setup. The table below displays data filtered on date and shape. The table displays information with 1/1/2010 as the date and triangle as the shape.

## Summary
The design of the analysis enables the user to extract necessary information but could be improved by the addition of drop down arrows in the filtering area. The current design does not enable the user to know all possible search parameters and could be improved by providing the user with a data range. Additionally, the table could be improved by removing placeholder text in the filter table, which can confuse the user as to which criteria they're currently using.
